Kitāb Mu'jam al-Buldān \cite{Yaqut} "Dictionary of Countries" was written by Yāqūt Shihāb al-Dīn ibn-ʿAbdullāh al-Rūmī al-Ḥamawī
between 1224 and 1228.

The Gazetteer is a "comprehensive index of places and places descriptions, mainly in the Muslim World ...
he (Yāqūt) depicted a semi-anachronistic look at the Muslim Caliphate in the 7th-10th centuries
"~\cite{YaqutRB}


At the time of writing, there is no exact number for the places detailed in the book, but there are at least 12,400 entries.
Some projects, however, distinguish multiple places if they are mentioned within a different entry, lacking
their own dedicated one.~\cite{AlTurayya}.
Example entries are shown on figure~\ref{fig:yaqut-entries}

\subsection{Parsed Dataset - Places}\label{subsec:parsed-dataset-places}
The layout of the gazetteer is highly structured.
Therefore, researchers were able to create a rule-based method to parse
and expose the data in a tabular database~\cite{YaqutRB}.
This database serves as the primary data source for this thesis.

\begin{figure}[h] % [h] attempts to place figure here, other options like [t]op, [b]ottom
    \centering % Centers the figure horizontally
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/yaqut-layout} % Include the image with desired width
    \caption{Example of a Muʿjam al-Buldān entry ~\cite{YaqutRB}} % Add a caption
    \label{fig:yaqut-structure} % Assign a label for referencing the figure in text
\end{figure}.

The primary, parsed datasource provided the following information:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Latitude
    \item Longitude
    \item Wikidata ID
    \item al-Turayyā ID~\cite{AlTurayya}
    \item Name (Arabic)
    \item Name (English)
    \item Type (lower hierarchy)
    \item Type (upper hierarchy)
    \item Metropolitan ID (reference to another place in the dataset)
    \item District ID (reference to another place in the dataset)
    \item Provincial ID (reference to another place in the dataset)
\end{itemize}


The only fields guaranteed to have data were the Arabic name and the unique identifier assigned based on the corresponding al-Turayyā gazetteer~\cite{AlTurayya}.

\subsubsection{al-Turayyā ID}
The IDs correspond to the database entries partially backing the al-Turayyā gazetteer project.
Namely, al-Turayyā used the same IDs to identify the OCR scanned entries.
A small caveat is that~\cite{YaqutRB} occasionally parsed multiple place descriptions from the same entry,
therefore, these entries have additional suffixes after the al-Turayyā ID to keep them unique.

\subsubsection{Wikidata ID}
Some more well-known and easily identifiable place entries, such as Baghdad, were already enriched with Wikidata~\cite{Wikidata} IDs.
This information was initially used to build some graphs, but later iterations skipped its use due to their unreliability.
As an example, the entry for Mecca, which is a highly central and important node, had the Wikidata ID of Q3289054
which refers to a city in the United States, not the Saudi Arabian city.

\subsubsection{Categories}
The rule-based parsing system also attempts to assign a category to each place entry.
The categories are selected from a pre-defined hand-verified list.

The categories are split into a two-level hierarchy.
For example, the level one category "town" has multiple sub-categories, like
village, small town, neighboring villages, or abodes.

However, not all entries will necessarily have a secondary category.
In total, there are 96 distinct categories; they are available in the Appendix~\ref{sec:appx-categories}.

\subsection{Parsed Dataset - Distances}
The other important block of data available in the parsed dataset are the distances.
Over a thousand entries parsed from the original book express some spatial relationship
between two places.
The dataset this thesis works with already contains this information in kilometers. However, it is important
to remember that the kilometer values provided vary significantly in accuracy. This
is because the original entries defined distance in terms of various non-standard methods
such as days of walking, traveling on camelback, and so on.
