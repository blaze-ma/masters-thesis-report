This project described various transformation and prediction tasks executed on the data generated by ~\cite{YaqutRB} that parsed the medieval gazetteer Kitāb Mu'jam al-Buldān written by Yâqût al-Hamawî ~\cite{Yaqut}
Initially, the various technologies and concepts that form the core of this thesis are introduced.
These concepts include but are not limited to: Knowledge Graphs, Graph Neural Networks, Neo4J, Wikidata and various
evaluation metrics such as Mean Rank and Hits@K.

Then, there is a short section describing the original gazetteer and its parsed version.
The graph, in its purest form includes only \textit{place} type nodes, relationship edges and distance edges.

Having established the base knowledge necessary to follow this thesis, the next sections analyse the initial parsed dataset represented as a graph.
This analysis includes metrics such as network density, average node degree and clustering.

Then, some initial link prediction experiments were performed using various scoring based models, as implemented in Ampligraph.
These approaches are, namely: TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, HolE, RotatE. However, these first approaches were lackluster
both in terms of statistical performance, and the ability to predict new, true links.
Within this section, there's also a dedicated part for discovering triplet candidates, as it is a computationally hard problem.
Various techniques, such as hop limiting and cluster triangles are detailed.

After analysing the shortcomings of the initial models, first, the structure of the graph was pruned.
The graph on which the previous models were trained on, included various ancillary edges and nodes scraped from Wikidata.

Previously, the graph's ontology did not differentiate between various distances, and treated them equally.
In later version, these edges are binned according to predefined categories.
Second, the hierarchical edges were explicitly defined across all levels.
Third, reverse edges were added.

While he initial models detailed in the previous sections performed marginally better with this new graph representation,
clearly, there was a need to experiment with recent state-of-the-art models.
Therefore, the rest of the thesis uses Neural Bellman-Ford Networks as its basis (NBFNet).
The model proposed in the NBFNet paper is currently SOTA for link prediction using the FB15K-237 dataset.

The next section evaluates the results after training the NBFNet model on the gazetteer dataset.
While the results are significantly better, it is concluded that it is possible to reach even better results
by pretraining the model on a similar, but orders of magnitude larger, synthetic dataset.

To create such dataset, the thesis relies on WorldKG, a geographical knowledge graph constructed based on Open Street
Maps data.

The data found in the WorldKG dataset is used to create a synthetic dataset mimicking Yāqūt's Kitāb Mu'jam al-Buldān,
but utilizing nodes from the entire world.
This synthetic dataset also allows the introduction of specific biases that are not commonly found in the original datasource,
but are of interest to the researchers.
For example: explicit distance edge to the largest settlement, within a certain radius, and the closest geographical neighbor.

Then, the performance of a pretrained NBFNet model is compared to previous experiments, showcasing the improvements.

Finally, in-line with recent developments in the field of machine which happened during the writing of this thesis.
The most successful NBFNet version is recreated, but using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in place of classic multilayer
perceptron.

The final section of the thesis concludes the results, and reflects on potential improvements, shortcomings, and future
research possibilities.
