After the lackluster result from the translation methods detailed in chapter~\ref{ch:knowledge-graph-embedding-methods}, the need for
experimentation with other approaches became apparent.

At the time of writing, the state-of-the art multi-relational link prediction methods~\cite{LPSOTA} are generally
based on, and expand on the message passing, Graph Neural network architecture.

Specifically, the top performing model, according to the Papers with Code benchmark on FB15k-237 link prediction~\cite{NBFNetSota}
are the Neural Bellman-Ford Networks (NBFNet).

Therefore, from now on, this thesis will focus on training an NBFNet model on the Kitāb Mu'jam al-Buldān dataset.
