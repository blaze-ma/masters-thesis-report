The first broad classification of link prediction methods explored in this thesis are the knowledge graph embedding methods (KGE).
Since graph neural networks generate node embeddings as well, the terminology is somewhat ambiguous.
The following few paragraphs will attempt to clearly distinguish the class of methods detailed in this chapter.

KGE methods attempt to position each node in a vector space (figure~\ref{fig:vec-space-vis}).
In a well-trained model, nodes from the same neighborhood will be placed near each other within the vector space.
Moreover, these positions are strictly unique, i.e.\ two distinct nodes cannot occupy the same place.
From this, naturally follows that KGE methods are strictly transductive, and cannot generalize.

Fortunately, a transductive setting is not necessarily limiting for the purposes of this thesis.
(TODO: WorldKG), as all the link-predictions tasks are limited
to the domain of places mentioned in Kitāb Mu'jam al-Buldān.

While there are exceptions to this rule, such as the ComplEx~\cite{ComplEx} discussed in TODO: ComplexRef
KGE methods are generally more efficient and easily more scalable than their GNN counterparts.
