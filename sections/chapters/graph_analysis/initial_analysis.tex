\subsection{"Network Density and Connectivity"}\label{subsec:"network-density-and-connectivity"}


Even with the disconnected nodes removed, the graph appears to be extremely sparse.
This is apparent from the density, which  may be calculated as follows:
\[
    D = \frac{2E}{N(N - 1)}
\]

With 8574 nodes and 10790 edges, the density is $~0.00029$.
Considering that a graph's density such that: ($0 \leq density \leq 1$), this graph is rather disconnected.
