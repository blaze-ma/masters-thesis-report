Within this thesis, two target edge categories are valuable to predict: distance and hierarchy.
Therefore, creating an initial investigative graph containing only this information is reasonable.
The graph will contain only place nodes, one node for each unique place ID. For simplicity, the distance edges
will not yet be binned, and each hierarchical relationship will explicitly be defined instead of relying on meta-paths.
The database engine storing the graph will be Neo4J~\cite{Neo4j}, populated by a Python script, while the analysis will be mainly done
with Gephi~\cite{Gephi}.

While building the graph, it became apparent that the number of disconnected nodes is exceedingly high (6289 nodes are orphans out of 14863 total nodes); therefore
the decision was made to only consider connected nodes as part of the graph, especially since the link prediction methods
require at least some connections.
