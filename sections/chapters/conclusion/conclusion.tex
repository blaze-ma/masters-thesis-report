This thesis explored various subjects, including knowledge graph construction~\ref{sec:building-complete-knowledge-graph},
experiments with Knowledge Graph Embedding models (chapter~\ref{ch:knowledge-graph-embedding-methods}), and Graph Neural Networks (chapter~\ref{ch:nbfnet}).
The research focused on two main areas of improvement: firstly, modifying or replacing the experimental models,
and secondly, continually experimenting with the methods of feeding the generated knowledge graph into the model.
Another area of the thesis was the construction of a second, larger synthetic knowledge graph mimicking the original
Kitāb KG, to train better NBFNet models (chapter~\ref{ch:worldkg}).

However, the most promising results came from false positive detection for Kitāb KG's source dataset.
It could be argued that the ultimate result of this thesis is an Error Detection model for the rule-based parser introduced in ~\cite{YaqutRB}
