There are many potential areas for improvement.
The largest area is the fact the pre-trained NBFNet model discussed in chapter~\ref{ch:worldkg} only hypothetically
outperforms the other models, but this hypothesis was not tested.

Second, the section on false positives highlighted many potential issues in the training dataset.
Perhaps better results all across the board could have been reached by aggressively filtering out these triplets.
In the same manner, the true positive prediction section~\ref{sec:generating-new-potentially-positive-triplets} showed how restrictive the distance bins are on the smaller end.

It could also have been interesting to explore rule-based methods or spend more time interpreting the NBFNet results
to generate such rules.
