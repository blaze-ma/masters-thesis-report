Although the performance metrics of the trained models fell short of the expectations.
The trained models could still potentially be used to generate valuable information,
especially in cases where the model is highly certain about the truth value of a triplet.

Moreover, due to how NBFNet works, the reasonings behind the model's predictions are human-interpretable.
Understanding these reasonings may also be used to create hand-made rule-based link prediction algorithms.

Some of these results were also analyzed and evaluated by the first author of~\cite{YaqutRB}, the
explanations provided also offer an interesting insight into the blind spots of the original rule-based model,
and why the NBFNet model struggled in some situations.
