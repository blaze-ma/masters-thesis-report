}{% the abstract
  This thesis investigates rule-based and machine learning approaches for enhancing a knowledge graph constructed from data parsed from the medieval gazeteer,
  Kitāb Mu'jam al-Buldān written by Yâqût al-Hamawî. The research employs state-of-the-art graph neural networks alongside classical embedding and rule-based techniques.
  An iterative approach is used, with continuous analysis guiding the knowledge graph's improvement.
