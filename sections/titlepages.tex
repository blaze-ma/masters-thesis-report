}{% the abstract
  This thesis explores data parsed~\cite{YaqutRB} from the medieval gazeteer,
  Kitāb Mu'jam al-Buldān written by Yâqût al-Hamawî~\cite{Yaqut}.
  First, a knowledge graph is constructed to represent the parsed data.
  Then various Knowledge Graph Embedding and an NBFNet~\cite{NBFNet} model are trained on the newly created the graph to predict new,
  previously unkown links, and detect potential false positives.

  Finally, this thesis attempts to improve the performance of a NBFNet model by pre-training it on a synthetic
  dataset generated from the knowledge graph WorldKG~\cite{WorldKG}
